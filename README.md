# Equibase-Data
Contains code that scrapes the Equibase Statistics page for most of its data. You cannot run this code, however, as scraping violates the company's terms of service; I discovered this fact after everything was already written. There's 8+ hours down the drain...

# About
### Why Put it on GitHub?
The code was so clean and well organized that it would be a shame to delete outright. Therefore, it will be left here for no one to use but for everyone to see.

The repo, however small, provides a great template for organizing projects. You can tell how the funcitons in the implementation script operate through their names, parameters, and comments, while all the abstract work is done behind the scenes in helper functions (which also have detailed comments and function names).

### The Code is Broken
The code does not work in its current state (or at any point in the commit history), as it was purposely sabotaged for public release. These subtle, yet crippling flaws require trained eyes to correct. They should be difficult enough to fix that I can share the elegance of the project without getting lawyers crawling down my back!

### R Version
This was written under R version 4.1.0.
